### Project Overview

 The following project gives an introduction of Logistic Regression and its usage


### Learnings from the project

 Upon the course of this project I learnt about Logistic Regression its usage in real life problems and one such problem is solved in this project


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Starting with analysis of the dataset, performing train_test split, checking collinearity among the various independent feature variables, creating  a logistic regression model, performing regularization on the model, cheking the model accuracy and plotting the model accuracy


### Challenges faced

 understanding the various parameters associated wtih logistic regression


### Additional pointers

 knowledge of linear regression and probability would be helpful
