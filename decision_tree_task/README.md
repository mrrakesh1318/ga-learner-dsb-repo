### Project Overview

 The project is an overview of the decision tree model of sklearn, which is a very intuitive model and ,can be used for both classification and regression tasks


### Learnings from the project

 Upon the completion of the project one can learn about loading the data, visualizing the data using seaborn, encoding the categorical features ,building a decision tree a classifier, pruning a decision tree and creating a graph from the data


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 initial steps are same as other linear or logistic model, loading the data, visualizing the data, performing label encoding on categorical , building a decision tree classifier, optimizing the decision tree using GridSearchCV and plotting a graph from the data


### Challenges faced

 setting up graphviz for creating graph is a tedious task


### Additional pointers

 overall knowledge of data preprocessing would be great
