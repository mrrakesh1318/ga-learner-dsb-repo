### Project Overview

 The project solves the problem on house price prediction


### Learnings from the project

 Upon the course of this project , I studied splitting the data, checking multi-collinearity among the features, applying multiple linear regression, using cross-validation


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 starting with splitting the data, performing linear regression, checking the efficiency of the linear regression using evaluation metrics like r-squared, then using regularization improving the model, and finally performing polynomial regression


### Challenges faced

 understanding cross-validation method, making pipeline for polynomial regression


### Additional pointers

 prior knowledge of cross-validation will be an added advantage
