### Project Overview

 The project is a summary of the various tasks involved during the data preprocessing tasks, data cleaning, missing values imputation, encoding categorical data, etc


### Learnings from the project

 Upon the course of the project I got an overview of the various tasks involved in the data preparation phase, checking the data for null values, treating missing values(using mean, median), methods of encoding categorical data using label encoder, treating skewness using log transformation


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach I followed is fixing the data by features one at a time


### Challenges faced

 Fixing the data was a bit tedious in the beginning but upon practice it was good


### Additional pointers

 Prior knowledge of python strings and various string operations would be helpgul in treating the data
