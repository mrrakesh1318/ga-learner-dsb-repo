### Project Overview

 The project gives an overview of the importance of feature selection and the different techniques of feature selection


### Learnings from the project

 Upon the course of the project I learnt the importance of feature selection in increasing the model efficiency


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I approached the problem seqeuntially performing one task at a time and resulting in the overall completion of the project


### Challenges faced

 Understanding the various modules associated with feature selection was tedious need to refer to external sources


### Additional pointers

 some of the modules are depricated
cross_validation from sklearn is depricated instead use train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
