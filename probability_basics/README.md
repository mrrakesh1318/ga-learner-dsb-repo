### Project Overview

 The project helps in understanding the basics of probability with the help of a dataset which contains the lending patterns


### Learnings from the project

 During the course of the project I learnt about the probability, comditonal probabiltiy, bayes theorem, discrete and continuous variables


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach was procedural since the task was sequential


### Challenges faced

 At the beginning it was difficult to get hold of bayes
