### Project Overview

 The project helps in understanding the various aspects of Linear Regression


### Learnings from the project

 Upon the course of this project, I used sklearn module of python for creating a linear regression model and various evaluation metrics involved in linear regression


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Firstly divide the data in features and targets, then perform train-test split, check the correlation among the features ,using sklearn create a linear regression model, fit the model using train data , predict using the trained model upon the test data, compare the actual values and the predicted values


### Challenges faced

 The challenge was visualiztion of the features vs target and that was good


### Additional pointers

 Reading about r-sqaured mean-squared error would be great
