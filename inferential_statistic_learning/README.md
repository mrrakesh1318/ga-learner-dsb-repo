### Project Overview

 This project helps in understanding the basis of inferencing, hypothesis testing


### Learnings from the project

 Upon the course of this project ,I understood the use cases of various inferencing methods, dsitributions, Central limit theorem, use of statistics and probability in the process of decision making


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach used in solving the problems are sequential


### Challenges faced

 The challenges were understanding about the various underlying methods z-statistic, p_values, types of distribution


### Additional pointers

 Have an understanding of the varoius statistic methods and concepts before wiil be great
