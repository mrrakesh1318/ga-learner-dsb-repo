### Project Overview

 The project is an introduction to clustering, I have used k-means clustering in this task, it is one of the most used clustering algorithm,and thus helps in the unsupervised learning tasks, whenever we solve unsupervised ML tasks the first thing which comes to mind is k-means
We solved a customer segmentation problem


### Learnings from the project

 Upon completion of the project I came across data manipulation, dimensionality reduction using PCA(Principal Component Analysis), k-means clustering, interpreting the clusters


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I approached the problem seqeuntially,
loading the data,
preparing the data for analysis,
applying the model,
predicting the clusters for the data points


### Challenges faced

 Manipulating the data, getting insights from the predicted data


### Additional pointers

 data manipulation is tedious at times
